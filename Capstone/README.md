# Open-Ended Capstone Project: Data-Driven Investing

## Overview:
#### The purpose of this project is to craft a data solution whereby investors can test the returns on a theoretical portfolio of stocks over a given timeframe using actual historical stock price data. 
#### The data solution will consist of financial data typically used for fundamental analysis (valuations and financial reports), historical end-of-day prices, and monthly macroeconomic data. 
#### An analyst will then be able to “back-test” a particular investing strategy given certain inputs, thresholds, and assumptions. 
#### The solution will serve as a tool for determining where and when to invest. 

### **DataCollection** - Python Scripts:
#### **getSandPData.py** - python script that downloads a list of S&P Companies (current and historical) and populates Companies table with Company metadata, and Prices table with stock prices by Date

### **InvestingDB** - MySQL Database Tables:
#### **Companies** (Stock Tickers) and Major Indexes with metadata
#### **Prices** (End of Day) for each Company / Index
