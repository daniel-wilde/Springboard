# Banking System Case Study
Users should be able to execute the console.py file and simulate a customer session at a bank from begining to end.

The customer session should be able to handle new and existing customers, and perform 0 to âˆž transactions until the customer is done.

Various transactions that the Customer can initiate include the following:   
	deposits, 
    withdrawals, 
    loan payments, 
    opening a new account, 
    closing an account, 
    opening a new loan for a specific amount and length of time

Account balances should be handled and saved after each transaction.

If the customer is done with their transaction(s) during the session, they may enter 'done' to exit the program.
